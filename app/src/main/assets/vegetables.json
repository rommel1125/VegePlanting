        "description" : "Eggplant, Solanum melongena, is a tropical, herbaceous, perennial plant, closely related to tomato, in the family Solanaceae which is grown for its edible fruit. The plants has a branching stem and simple, long, flat. coarsely lobed leaves which are green in color and are arranged alternately on the branches. The leaves can measure 10 to 20 cm (4–8 in) long and 5 to 10 cm (2–4 in) broad. The plant produces purple flowers which are 3–5 cm (1.2–2.0 in) in diameter. The fruit is a large, fleshy ovoid berry which can reach 40 cm (15.7 in) in length, with glossy smooth skin and numerous small seeds. The color of the fruit is variable and can be white, green, yellow, purple or black. Eggplants can reach up to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in height and although they are perennial plants, they are most commonly grown as annuals. Eggplant may also be referred to as aubergine or guinea squash and originates from the Indian subcontinent.\nUses\nEggplant is usually cooked before consumption and is eaten as a vegetable.\nPropagation\nBasic requirements Eggplants are warm-season crops which require a long growing season.They grow best in regions where the daytime temperature is between 26 and 32°C (80–90°F) and night time temperatures around 21°C (70°F). In addition, eggplant is a sun loving plant and should be positioned in an area that receives full sunlight. Plants will perform best when planted in a fertile soil with a pH between 6.3 and 6.8. Sowing seeds In cold areas and regions with a short growing season it is necessary to start eggplant indoors or in a glasshouse. In addition, eggplant will often perform much better in colder areas if planted in containers or grown under row covers as this helps to keep the soil warm. Seeds should be sown indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last frost date. Sow seeds thickly in seed trays containing good quality sterile seed starting mix to a depth of 6 mm (0.25 in). Keep the trays moist and provide bottom heat by placing on a heat mat or in a warm area of the house. Seedling should be potted into larger pots when they have two sets of true leaves. Transplanting Eggplant seedlings can be transplanted after hardening-off and when all danger of frost has passed in your area. Seedlings should be spaced 45–60 cm (18–24 in) apart, depending on variety, allowing a further 60–90 cm (24–36 in) between rows. General care and maintenance Eggplant may benefit from the addition of mulch to conserve soil moisture and maintain a higher soil temperature. Row covers will help to increase the temperature around the plants in cooler climates and during cool spells in otherwise warm areas. The row covers should be removed to allow pollinators to access the plants during flowering. Eggplant should be provided with a steady water supply for optimum development of fruit and the soil around the plants should not be allowed to dry out but should also not be wet. Plants can be laden with numerous fruit and the use of stakes and supports can help to support the plants before harvest. Harvesting Eggplant fruits are ready to harvest while the flesh is still firm and seeds are small and tightly packed. The skin of the fruit should be firm, glossy and dark purple. Over ripe fruit will contain darker seeds and will taste bitter. Harvest the fruit as soon as it is ripe to ensure maximum productivity. The fruit should be removed from the plant by cutting the calyx (green stem above the fruit) with a sharp knife.",

        "name" : "TOMATO",
        "description" : "Tomato, Lycopersicum esculentum (syn. Solanum lycopersicum and Lycopersicon lycopersicum) is an herbaceous annual in the family Solanaceae grown for its edible fruit. The plant can be erect with short stems or vine-like with long, spreading stems. The stems are covered in coarse hairs and the leaves are arranged spirally. The tomato plant produces yellow flowers, which can develop into a cyme of 3–12, and usually a round fruit (berry) which is fleshy, smoothed skinned and can be red, pink, purple, brown, orange or yellow in color. The tomato plant can grow 0.7–2 m (2.3–6.6 ft) in height and as an annual, is harvested after only one growing season. Tomato may also be referred to as love apple and originates from South America.\n\nUses\nTomato fruit can be eaten raw or cooked and is used in many dishes. The fruit may also be processed into juice, soup, ketchup, puree, paste or powder.\n\nPropagation\nRequirements Tomatoes grow very well in warm areas at temperatures between 21 and 24°C (69.8–75.2°F). They require a deep, loamy, well-draining soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.8. If soil drainage is a problem then tomatoes can be planted in a raised bed. Like all fruiting plants, tomatoes require full sun for most of the day. Tomato varieties Determinate (“bush”) tomatoes have been purposefully bred to grow vertically and remain relatively compact. The plant will stop growing once fruit begins developing on the terminal shoot and all the fruits ripen at around the same time. In contrast, indeterminate (“vining”) tomato varieties spread laterally and will continue to grow and produce fruit until frosts begin the the Fall. Indeterminate varieties can produce fruit all season and fruits will develop and ripen at different times. Heirloom tomatoes are generally open-pollinated varieties which have been conserved over many generations due to certain desirable characteristics such as flavor. Hybrid tomatoes are the product of cross-pollination between two parents with desirable characteristics such as high yield, early maturation, improved flavor or resistance to certain diseases. Sowing seeds In most cases, tomato seeds should be started indoors 6–8 weeks before last Spring frost. Seeds can be direct seeded in areas with a long growing season. Seeds should be sown in flats or cell trays using a sterile seedling mix. Plant seeds to a depth of 0.6 cm (1/4 in) and water lightly. If cells are being used, plant several seeds in each cell and thin to 1 seedling after germination. Position trays in a bright South facing window or under fluorescent lighting. The optimum soil temperature for germination is 21–32°C (70–90°F). A heat mat can be used to warm the flats if required. Seedlings should emerge within 6-14 days and after the seedlings has developed the first set of true leaves then they can be moved to a larger (3-4 in) pot and moved to a cooler temperature (16–21°C/60–70°F). Transplanting Tomato seedlings are ready to be transplanted once they are 15–25 cm (6–10 in) in height and have 3–5 true leaves assuming all danger of frost has passed. Beginning approximately 7-10 days before transplanting, plants should be set outside to harden off (see https://www.plantvillage.com/posts/264). The transplanting site should be prepared by working in a balanced fertilizer according to the guidelines on the product label. Transplants should be spaced 76–123 cm (30–48 in) apart with a between row spacing of 123 cm (48 in). It is common practice to plant tomatoes in trenches on their side (see https://www.plantvillage.com/posts/833-tomato) as tomato stems will sprout roots along their length when buried. Avoid over-fertilizing transplants, particularly with nitrogen, at this stage of growth as it will promote growth of foliage rather than fruits. Water plants lightly at base instead of overhead as wet foliage is more prone to diseases and the buried stem needs time to adapt and sprout roots. It is important that tomato plants receive even watering to prevent the development of blossom end rot, drip or soaker hoses work best and mulching around the plants helps to conserve soil moisture. Stakes, Cages and Trellises Staking, caging or trellising tomatoes supports the plants and helps to keep fruit off of the ground as well as increasing air circulation around the foliage which helps to prevent disease. The type of support system used depends on the type of tomatoes being grown. Determinate tomatoes have short or medium length vines and stop growing once fruit develops on the terminal branches. Determinates can be staked or caged but do not adapt to trellises. The position of the fruit means that little heavy pruning is required. In contrast, indeterminate tomatoes grow indefinitely and require a support system to prevent them trailing along the ground. The amount of pruning required depends on the support system being utilized - vines require only light pruning when caged, moderate pruning when staked and heavy pruning when using a trellis.",

You can also buy seeds from the garden section of a department store. If you want to collect seeds from a plant, then you will need at least one tomato from that plant. Make sure the tomato is from a plant that was grown from an heirloom or open pollinated seed. If you choose tomatoes from a hybrid, or a plant with chemically-treated seeds, the results may not be as impressive. A tomato plant may be categorized by:\n\n\t-Heirloom or Hybrid: Heirlooms are tomatoes that have been genetically reproduced for several generations without any cross-breeding. Essentially, they're pure-bred tomatoes. Hybrid tomatoes are a cross between two varieties.\n\n\t-Determinate or Indeterminate: This method of classification describes the length of time for which a plant produces fruit. Determinate plants produce for a few weeks, while indeterminate plants produce fruit throughout an entire growing season until climate conditions become too cold. Indeterminate plants also grow larger and require more care in terms of pruning and staking.\n\n\t-Shape: Tomatoes are also classified into four categories of shape: globe, beefsteak, paste, and cherry.

        "description" : "The cabbage plant, Brassica oleracea, is an herbaceous annual or biennial vegetable in the family Brassicaceae grown for its edible head. There are many different varieties of cabbage which include the white and red cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) and the savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. sabauda. The head of the cabbage is round and forms on a short thick stem. The leaves are thick and alternating with wavy or lobed edges and the roots are are fibrous and shallow. The plant produces large yellow flowers. The densely leaved heads can range in size from 0.5 to 3.6 kg (1-8 lb) depending on variety. The plant is usually grown as an annual. Brassica oleracea may be referred to as cabbage, Shetland cabbage, Savoy cabbage, white cabbage or red cabbage and is believed to have originated from a wild cabbage ancestor in ancient Asia minor.\n\nUses\nCabbage is primarily grown for consumption as a vegetable, eaten after boiling or steaming. Some cultivars are grown as fodder for animals. Red cabbage is commonly pickled\n\nPropagation\nBasic requirements Cabbage is cool season crop that grows best in cool, moist conditions. The plant will grow best at temperatures between 4 and 21°C (40–50°F) allowing it to be grown in both Spring and Fall. Cabbage will grow optimally in a rich, moist, well draining soil With a pH of 6.5. The plant requires at least six hours of direct sunlight every day. Sowing seeds Cabbage can be direct seeded or started indoors to produce transplants. The optimum soil temperature for germination is between 12 and 24°C (55–75°F). Cabbage seeds can be planted outdoors 6–8 weeks before the last spring frost date in a cold frame and transplanted to their final location approximately 4 weeks before the last frost. If planting for a fall harvest, cabbage can be direct seeded 6–8 weeks before the first frost date. Prepare the soil for planting through the addition of nitrogen in the form of bone meal or composted manure. Plant cabbage seeds 6 mm (0.25 in) deep allowing 10–15 cm (4–6 in) between plants in the row and a 0.6 to 1.2 m (2–4 ft) between rows. Thin seedlings to a final within row spacing of 45–60 cm (18–24 in). Keep soil moist during germination to prevent a crust from forming on the soil surface as this will cause uneven germination. Transplanting Seedlings started indoors or in a cold frame are ready to be transplanted when they have 3–4 leaves and the daytime temperature has reached 10°C (50°F). Seedling should be planted at the final spacing for seeds (45–60 cm/18–24 in between plants and 0.6 to 1.2 m/2–4 ft between rows). Plant each seedling slightly deeper than it was previously. The plantings can be staggered in 2 week intervals to prolong the harvest. General care and maintenance Cabbage should be kept evenly watered to ensure the development of tight heads. Uneven watering can cause heads to crack. Application of mulch around plants helps to conserve soil moisture. Cabbage plants have shallow roots and in order to avoid damaging them, it is preferable to hand pull any weeds growing around the plants. Cabbages are heavy feeders and require the addition of fertilizer to meet their growth requirements and develop optimally. Fertilize the plants when they are beginning to form new leaves and starting to develop heads. Harvesting Cabbages are ready to harvest when the head is fully formed and feels firm and well-packed when squeezed. Cut the head away from the stalk with a sharp knife. Leaving the stalks in the ground will result in the formation of several smaller heads which can also be harvested and eaten.",

        "description" : "Squash is the collective name given to several species of plant in the genus Cucurbita, including C. maxima, C. mixta , C. moschata and C. pepo, which are widely grown for their edible fruit. Squash plants are are herbaceous annual plants which are either trailing vines or bush-like in morphology. Vines generally have large, lobed leaves and long vines which can climb by attaching to surfaces with their tendrils. Bushes generally take up less space than the sprawling vine types and may have prickly leaves. Squash plants produce yellow or orange flowers and green, white or yellow fruit in a variety of shapes and sizes with smooth or ridged skin. Vining squash varieties can reach several meters in length and, as annuals, survive only one growing season. Squash originate from North and Central America and are referred to by their cultivar name e.g. acorn squash, butternut squash, spaghetti squash, zucchini, banana squash, hubbard squash and buttercup squash.\n\nUses\nSquash fruit can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable. Some varieties are grown as ornamentals.\n\nPropagation\nBasic requirements Squash is a warm-season crop, requiring lots of sun and good drainage to develop optimally and growing best at temperatures between 18 and 25°C (65–75°F). Squash will yield best if grown in a fertile, well-draining soil, rich in organic matter and with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5. Squash should be planted in full sun and provided with ample soil moisture due to their shallow root system. Vining varieties can grow to very large sizes and require a good deal of space. Smaller bush varieties are available for more modest spaces. Propagation Squash is propagated from seed and can be direct seeded or sown indoors and transplanted. If direct seeding,seeds should be sown after the last frosts and when the soil has warmed to at least 15.6°C (60°F). Sow 1–2 seeds 1.3–2.5 cm (0.5–1.0 in) deep, at least 90 cm (~3 ft) apart if growing bush varieties and 120–150 cm (4–5 ft) apart if growing vining varieties. Allow a further 1–3 m (6–10 ft) between rows depending on the variety. If transplanting, seeds should be sown 3–4 weeks before the last frost date in your area and transplanted before the plants develop their second set of true leaves. Seeds in sown both indoors and out require lightly moist soil for germination, care should be taken to avoid overwatering. Seeds should germinate in 5–10 days depending on the soil temperature. General care and maintenance Squash vines are sprawling and require plenty space to grow. Vines can be trained to grow on a trellis or fence. Squash also require a continuous supply of water and where drip irrigation is not being used, plants should be watered deeply once per week, providing at least an inch of water. Shallow watering or watering less frequently encourages a shallow root system. Mulches can be used to conserve soil moisture and black polyethylene mulch has the advantage of warming the soil. All squash varieties produce both male and female flowers (monoecious) and are pollinated by insects such as bees. Harvesting Squash is ready to harvest when the rind is hard and cannot be punctured with a fingernail. The skin of mature fruits is dull and dry in appearance, especially when compared with the shiny skin of an immature fruit.",

        "name" : "WATER SPINACH",
        "description" : "Water Spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) is a member of the Convolvulaceae (Morning glory) family and the same genus as the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). Water spinach is an herbaceous aquatic or semi-aquatic perennial plant of the tropics and subtropics. It has a creeping growth habit but may grow erect in water. There are two major cultivars of water spinach. Ching Quat, also known as “green stem” water spinach, has narrow leaves and white flowers and is usually grown in moist soils. Pak Quat, also known as “white stem” water spinach, has arrow-shaped leaves and pink flowers and is grown in aquatic conditions, similar to rice.\n Almost all parts of the young plant tissue are edible, but the tender shoot tips and younger leaves are preferred. Other names of water spinach include: water convolvulus, swamp cabbage (English); kankon, you-sai (Japanese); ong tsoi, weng cai (Cantonese); toongsin tsai (Mandarin); kang kong (Filipino, Malaysian); kang kung, rau muong (Vietnamese); pak bung (Thai); batata acquatica, cancon (Portuguese). \nIpomoea aquatica is a federal noxious weed in the United States. Under authority of the Federal Noxious Weed Act, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) prohibits the importation and interstate movement of this species, except under a USDA-issued noxious weed permit. Water spinach is on the federal noxious weed list because it becomes an established weed in fresh water-ways in tropical climates. It has become an established weed in several southern states in the United States. \nThe UMass Extension Vegetable Team has worked with federal and state regulators to create a permitting system for the legal growth and sale of water spinach in Massachusetts. Since water spinach is extremely sensitive to frost, it does not pose a threat to water systems in Massachusetts. To find out about growing this crop legally in the United States, contact the APHIS web site for more information. \n\nProduction\nWater spinach is a frost sensitive plant. Optimal temperatures for growth are between 75° and 85° F and chilling injury can occur below 50° F. The cultivar Ching Quat is grown in moist soils, often in beds. Direct seed or transplants may be used. Many Asian growers in Massachusetts will soak the seed until germination to ensure the seed is viable. Growers plant in beds with 6 – 10 seeds per foot in rows that are 6 – 8 inches wide. Plant stems are not strong, but plants grown in beds support each other and produce longer stems with less branching, which is what the market prefers.\nWater spinach needs much more water than most other vegetable crops. This increased irrigation can leach out readily available nutrients, so it is recommended to use slow-release forms of fertility. Harvest of the entire plant can be made 50 to 60 days after planting. Plants are harvested by cutting the stem close to the ground and then nitrogen is applied to encourage re-growth. Shoots regrow readily and in Massachusetts, growers will get two to three cuttings of water spinach before frost. The cultivar Pak Quat requires the same aquatic environment as paddy rice, meaning it can’t be grown viably in New England.",

        "description" : "Lettuce, Lactuca sativa, is a leafy herbaceous annual or biennial plant in the family Asteraceae grown for its leaves which are used as a salad green. The lettuce plant can vary greatly in size, shape and leaf type but generally, the leaves of the plant form a dense head or loose rosette. The stem of the plant is short, with larger leaves arranged at the bottom and becoming progressively smaller further up the stem. Leaves can be smooth or curly and are usually green or red in color. The lettuce plant can grow to a height of 30–100 cm (12–40 in) in height and is typically grown as an annual, harvested after only one growing season. Lettuce may be referred to as garden lettuce and is believed to originate from Asia Minor and the Middle East. \n\nUses \nLettuce is primarily eaten raw as a salad green. Some varieties can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable.\n\n Propagation \nRequirements Lettuce is a cool season crop which will grow optimally at daytime temperatures of 15–20°C (59–68°F). The plant can be grown in a wide range of soils as long as it is fertile and moisture retaining due to the small root system of the plant. It is often grown in alkaline soil (pH greater than 7.0) but will not tolerate acid soil. Heat tolerant varieties can be grown over the summer months and care should be taken to protect the leaves from strong sun by shading or covering to prevent the plants from bolting. Sowing seeds Lettuce seeds can be sown directly in the garden or field as soon as the soil can be worked as the seeds will germinate at temperatures of 4.4°C (40°F) and above and seedlings will tolerate a light frost. Seeds should be sown 0.3–0.6 cm (1/8–1/4 in) deep and 2.5 cm (1 in) apart, leaving 50 cm (20 in) between rows. Cover the seeds lightly, tamp the soil and water the seeds. Seedlings should emerge in 2–15 days. When the plants have 2–3 true leaves then they should be thinned to a final spacing of 25–45 cm (10 to 18 in) depending on the variety. Plant new seeds every 2–3 weeks for a continuous harvest. Transplants Sow seeds in seedling trays in a sterile seed starting mix at a rate of approximately 3–4 seeds per inch (2.5 cm). Young plants can be potted up into larger pots or cell trays when they are about 2 weeks old. Plant transplants in the garden after hardening off, spacing plants 25–45 cm (10 to 18 in) (depending on variety) and allowing 50 cm (20 in) between rows. Plant new seeds every 2–3 weeks for a continuous harvest.",

The young fruits are edible and are usually cooked as a vegetable. The mature gourds are made into water bottles, dippers, spoons, pipes, and many other utensils and containers; they can also be fashioned into birdhouses, fancy ornaments, lamps, and musical instruments. Additionally, the vine’s showy white flowers and dense foliage make it a popular screen and ornamental plant.\n\n Bottle gourd vines are quick-growing annuals with hairy stems, long forked tendrils, and a musky odour. Many forms of the bottle gourd have been cultivated for specific purposes, and the sizes of the vines, leaves, and flowers, as well as the sizes and shapes of the fruits, vary greatly. The forms are named for the shape of the fruit—e.g., club, dipper, dolphin, kettle, and trough. The fruits of some cultivated varieties may be more than 1 metre (about 3 feet) long. The plants may be grown easily from seed but require a long hot growing season to mature.",

It bears simple, alternate leaves 4–12 cm (1.6–4.7 in) across, with three to seven deeply separated lobes. Each plant bears separate yellow male and female flowers. In the Northern Hemisphere, flowering occurs during June to July and fruiting during September to November.\n The fruit has a distinct warty exterior and an oblong shape. It is hollow in cross-section, with a relatively thin layer of flesh surrounding a central seed cavity filled with large, flat seeds and pith. The fruit is most often eaten green, or as it is beginning to turn yellow. At this stage, the fruit's flesh is crunchy and watery in texture, similar to cucumber, chayote or green bell pepper, but bitter. The skin is tender and edible. Seeds and pith appear white in unripe fruits; they are not intensely bitter and can be removed before cooking. \n\nSome sources claim the flesh (rind) becomes somewhat tougher and more bitter with age, but other sources claim that at least for the common Chinese variety the skin does not change and bitterness decreases with age. The Chinese variety are best harvested light green possibly with a slight yellow tinge or just before. The pith becomes sweet and intensely red; it can be eaten uncooked in this state, and is a popular ingredient in some Southeast Asian salads. \nWhen the fruit is fully ripe, it turns orange and soft, and splits into segments which curl back to expose seeds covered in bright red pulp. \n\nVarieties\nBitter melon comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. The cultivar common in China is 20–30 cm (7.9–11.8 in) long, oblong with bluntly tapering ends and pale green in colour, with a gently undulating, warty surface. The bitter melon more typical of India has a narrower shape with pointed ends, and a surface covered with jagged, triangular \"teeth\" and ridges. It is green to white in colour. Between these two extremes are any number of intermediate forms. Some bear miniature fruit of only 6–10 cm (2.4–3.9 in) in length, which may be served individually as stuffed vegetables. These miniature fruit are popular in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal and other countries in South Asia. The sub-continent variety is most popular in Bangladesh and India.",
